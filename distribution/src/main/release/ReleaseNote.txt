Scribble 2.0.0.M6
=================

This release contains updates to the protocol syntax ready for version 1 of the
protocol syntax. Some issues remain to be resolved, but contains the major changes,
including two forms of choice syntax, and the 'introduces' approach and role parameter
passing, rather than role lists.

Scribble 2.0.0.M4
=================

This release includes some model simplifications following the removal of the old
conformance checking implementation, which was unnecessarily complex.

The other reason for this release is to act as a stable baseline for the Savara 2.0.0.M1
release, and also in preparation for the migration to github.

Scribble 2.0.0.M3
=================

This release contains a number of bug fixes and slight changes to the notation.

Scribble 2.0.0.M2
=================

This release includes some changes to the protocol notation:

a) Recursion has changed to:
rec <label> {
	...
	<label>;
}

This change has also resulted in the renaming of the LabelledBlock model object to RecBlock.

b) Import has changed to:
import <typeSystem> "<type>" as <alias> ( , "<type>" as <alias> )* from "<location>";

as well as the simple form, e.g. import <type>,<type>....;

c) A new 'unordered' construct

d) The choice construct has changed syntax to:
choice from <role> to <role> {
    <message signature>:
        ...
    <message signature>:
        ...
}

e) The protocol/run syntax has changed in the way in deals with parameter passing. The
protocol now defines the set of parameter definitions, and the parameter values will be
passed by value based on position (in this release the binding/assignment approach is still
being used to define the parameter values being passed).

As part of this change, the current Parameter class has been renamed to ParameterDefinition,
and DeclarationBinding renamed to Parameter.

Scribble 2.0.0.M1
=================

This is the first milestone release for version 2 of the Scribble Language and Tooling.

This version of the language has focused on defining a core set of constructs that can
representation a wide range of communication protocols between multiple parties. These
constructs are also supported by theory, enabling a greater level of validation techniques
to be applied over time.

This initial release provides Java based tooling in the following areas:

- a parser for the type language (assertion support will be available soon)
- a subset of the language validation rules
- an endpoint projection implementation
- a conformance checking implementation for verifying a local model against a global model
- exporting a protocol object model to textual representation
- exporting a model to a finite state machine representation used for monitoring
- a protocol monitor

The capabilities can be used in two environments:

1) Command line environment - this is available in the main distribution available on the
Scribble downloads page. This distribution also contains all the required Jars, which can
then be linked into any application for embedded use of Scribble tooling, as well as the
samples which can be imported into the following Eclipse environment.

2) Eclipse - the capabilities can also be installed as Eclipse plugins using the update
site specified on the Scribble downloads page.

NOTE: Currently only the parser and validation modules are directly used in the Eclipse
environment, triggered when a Scribble protocol file (with extension .spr) is created or
modified.
