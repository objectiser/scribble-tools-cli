    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>This developers guide is intended for two groups of developers,</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          those wishing to develop applications that make use of (i.e. integrate) components
          
          of the Scribble tool chain, and
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          those wishing to develop additional components (or alternative implementations)
          
          for the Scribble tool chain
          
          The document initially discusses information about the project itself, to provide
          
          background information on how issues are managed, and the build and distribution
          
          performed.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The document then discusses the architecture of the tool chain.</para>
    <para>
      Finally we will look in more detail at how a validation module can be added to the
      
      tool chain.
    </para>
