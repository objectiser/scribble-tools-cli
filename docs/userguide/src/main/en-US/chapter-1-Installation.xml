    <title>Installation</title>

      This is the installation guide for the Scribble tools. Scribble is a notation for describing
      
      interaction based protocols between multiple parties.

      <para>The pre-requisites for the Scribble design time tools are:</para>

      </orderedlist>
      <para>
        The design time tools are Java based, so you will need a suitable JVM (Java Virtual
        
        Machine) to run the tools. If you also intend to generate Java APIs, for use at
        
        runtime, then you will need a JDK (Java Development Kit).
        
        Download the version 1.6 (or higher) from the
        
        <ulink url="http://www.java.com"/>
        . Once
        
        downloaded, follow the instructions to install the JVM or JDK on your system.

        The Scribble protocol descriptions can be edited using a standard text editor, and
        
        the Scribble tools can be invoked using command line tools (as described in the
        
        following chapter).
        
        However it is also possible to use the Scribble tools from within the Eclipse
        
        IDE environment, by installing the Scribble tools as plugins. If you wish to use
        
        this approach, then you will need a version of Eclipse (3.6 or higher) which can
        
        be downloaded from the Eclipse website:
        
        <ulink url="http://www.eclipse.org"/>

        The commands can be executed from the
        <code>bin</code>
        folder of the Scribble tools
        
        distribution. Alternatively, the
        <code>bin</code>
        folder can be
        
        added to the execution path, to enable the commands to be performed from
        
        any folder.
        
        For example, on Linux running bash, simply edit the
        <code>.bash_profile</code>
        
        file within your home directory to add:

        NOTE: Currently on Windows it is only possible to run the scripts from the
        <code>bin</code>
        folder.

      <title>Installing the Eclipse Version</title>
      <para>
        The Eclipse plugins for the Scribble tools can be loaded from an update site
        
        using the update manager.
      </para>
      <para>
        Select the
        <emphasis role="italics">Help-&gt;Install New Software...</emphasis>
        menu item, from
        
        your Eclipse environment, and follow the instructions.
      </para>
      <para>
        If installing a stable or development milestone release of the tools, then
        
        the plugins can be installed directly from the network. If installing a nightly
        
        build of the plugins, to access the latest (but unstable) version of the tools,
        
        then it will be necessary to download the update site as an archive, and point
        
        the Eclipse update manager at the downloaded zip file.
      </para>
      <para>
        The location of the stable, development and nightly builds can be found on the
        
        Scribble download page:
        
        <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/scribble/downloads"/>
        .

      <para>
        Once the Eclipse environment has restarted, and if the distribution has been downloaded
        
        and expanded, then the next step is to import the samples into the Eclipse
        
        workspace.
      </para>
      <para>
        This can be done by selecting the
        <emphasis role="italics">Import-&gt;General-&gt;Existing Projects into Workspace</emphasis>
        
        and locating the
        <code>samples</code>
        folder from the Scribble
        
        distribution.
      </para>
      <para>
        This will display the set of projects within the
        <code>samples</code>
        
        folder, which can either be individually selected, or all imported at once.
        
        Once imported, the Scribble Protocol files can be opened by double clicking
        
        the file, to open the protocol context sensitive editor.
