      <title>Protocol Definition</title>
      <para>The protocol definition is comprised of a:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Imports
            
            A list of import statements that can reference types (messages or other
            
            protocols) in other namespaces, optionally providing a URL to the
            
            detailed information about the type.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Protocol unit
            
            The protocol definition contains a single top level protocol unit, with
            
            a name that is scoped to the previously defined namespace.
            
            The syntax for the process definition is:
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[( import [ <TypeSystem> ]
			[ "<DataType>" as ] <name>
			( "," [ "<DataType>" as ] <name> )*
			[ from "<Location>" ] ";" )*

protocol <name> [ "at" <Role> ] "(" ( role | <Type> ) <name>
	    ( "," role | <Type> ) <name> )* ")" "{"
    .... ";"
"}"]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        The import statement is used to define a type that will be used within the protocol definition.
        
        When referenced in the protocol, the type is known by a local name (or alias). If we want to be
        
        able to monitor, or use the protocol definition in any other 'real world' situation, then we
        
        need to bind the concrete type information to this alias.
      </para>
      <para>
        The import statement can optionally define a type system associated with the imported type.
        
        For example, this could be 'java' if referring to a Java class or interface, or 'xsd'
        
        for an XSD type or element.
      </para>
      <para>
        Within the type information, we can identify a specific data type, followed by
        
        the 'as' keyword and then the name of the type alias.
      </para>
      <para>
        The import can optionally specify the location of the type information, by specifying the
        
        'from' keyword followed by a string literal with type system specific location information.
      </para>
      <para>
        In its simpliest form, the import can just define the type name, which will be represented
        
        without any type system specific information. The next level can introduce a type specific
        
        'data type' value. Finally the most complete version will include the location of the
        
        type information.
      </para>
      <para>
        Following the import statements is the declaration of the protocol unit
        
        itself. This defines the name of the protocol and whether it is located at
        
        a particular role.
      </para>
      <para>The following represents a 'global' protocol example:</para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[import Customer;

import xsd "{http://www.acme.org/Purchasing}Order" as Order,
	"{http://www.acme.org/Purchasing}Quote" as Quote
	from "../schema/MySchema.xsd";

import java "Order" as Order,
	"Quote" as Quote
	from "org.scribble";

protocol PurchaseGoods (role Buyer) {
    Buyer introduces Seller;
    Order from Buyer to Seller;
    ....
}]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        This example shows three variations of the import statement.
        
        The first importing a single type based on a
        
        name, without any concrete type information being bound.
      </para>
      <para>
        The second importing a particular XSD schema, from a
        
        schema location, and referring to two specific types within the schema.
        
        The first being an XSD type, known by the qualified name
        
        <emphasis role="italics">{</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="italics">[http://www.acme.org/Purchasing]</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="italics">}Order</emphasis>
        and
        
        locally referred to using the alias
        <emphasis role="italics">Order</emphasis>
        .
        
        The second being an XSD element, known by the qualified name
        
        <emphasis role="italics">{</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="italics">[http://www.acme.org/Purchasing]</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="italics">}Quote</emphasis>
        and
        
        locally referred to using the alias
        <emphasis role="italics">Quote</emphasis>
        .
      </para>
      <para>
        The third import statement shows the case where two Java classes
        
        are bound to local aliases. The Java package is specified
        
        within the 'from' clause, and the class name is defined prior
        
        to the 'as' keyword in each case.
      </para>
      <para>
        The global protocol is then defined, named as
        <emphasis role="italics">PurchaseGoods</emphasis>
        .
        
        This is a global protocol because it does not specify a particular
        
        role at which the definition is located.
      </para>
      <para>A local protocol variation would be:</para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[protocol PurchaseGoods at Buyer (role Buyer) {
    Buyer introduces Seller;
    Order to Seller;
    ....
}]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        This local representation of the protocol defines the behaviour from the
        <emphasis role="italics">Buyer</emphasis>
        
        role's perspective. That is why the interaction defined within the protocol unit only
        
        include the 'to role'
        <emphasis role="italics">Seller</emphasis>
        , as this is the role with which the
        
        <emphasis role="italics">Buyer</emphasis>
        is going to communicate. The
        <emphasis role="italics">Buyer</emphasis>
        role in the interaction is implied from the located role of the local protocol.
      </para>
      <para>
        The protocol can also be defined with parameters, to allow other protocols to invoke them
        
        with specific values. Below is a variation of the previous example, with the roles
        
        passed into the protocol instead.
      </para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[protocol PurchaseGoods(role Buyer, role Seller) {
    ....
}]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        The way in which another protocol can be invoked will be presented in a subsequent
        
        section.

      <title>Interaction</title>
      <para>Interactions in Scribble are based on two assumptions:</para>

      </informalexample>
      <para>
        The following example shows a similar type of interaction as shown in the
        
        'hello world' example.
      </para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[Customer introduces Supplier;
Order from Customer to Supplier;]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        In this sample, two roles are declared, with the interaction indicating that
        
        a message of type 'Order' will be sent from role 'Customer' to role 'Supplier'.
      </para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[placeOrder(Order) from Customer to Supplier;]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        This example demonstrates an alternative way for the exchanged message to be
        
        specified. In the first sample a message-style was used. In this sample, an
        
        RPC style has been used, specifying the operation name with type parameters.
        
        In this case, only a single typed parameter
        <emphasis role="italics">Order</emphasis>
        has
        
        been specified, but this could be a comma separated list of one or more
        
        types.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          When specifying interactions, it is not possible to just define an operation
          
          name with no type parameters.

        <para>This example demonstrates one of the main distinctions between the directed and located choice constructs. The direct choice defines the source and destination roles, and each path of the choice construct must send a message between those roles.</para>
        <para>
          In the located choice, as shown in the example above, only the source role is defined, which means that each choice path has the flexibility to send messages to different destination roles. So in the example above, it means that the

        In the following example, the body of the
        <emphasis role="italics">do</emphasis>
        block is enacted,
        
        involving an interaction between a
        <emphasis role="italics">Buyer</emphasis>
        and
        <emphasis role="italics">Seller</emphasis>
        ,

      <para>
        During this scoped set of activities, if the

        returns an
        
        <emphasis role="italics">OutOfStock</emphasis>
        message, then it will cause the flow of control to
        
        move to the first interrupt block. However if the
        <emphasis role="italics">Buyer</emphasis>
        sends an
        
        <emphasis role="italics">OrderExpired</emphasis>
        or
        <emphasis role="italics">OrderCancelled</emphasis>
        message,

      <para>
        Protocols can be defined in a modular way, with one protocol
        
        being able to compose another using the
        <emphasis role="italics">run</emphasis>
        construct.
      </para>
      <para>
        The
        <emphasis role="italics">run</emphasis>
        construct composes another protocol in
        
        a synchronous manner. This means that the composed protocol will
        
        complete before any subsequent activity in the composing protocol
        
        can proceed.
      </para>
      <para>There are two ways in which another protocol can be composed. These are:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Nested
            
            The nested variation defines the sub-protocol as an inner part of the
            
            composing protocol - in a similar way to an inner class in Java.
          </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            External
            
            The external variation defines the sub-protocol in a separate
            
            protocol definition, which is then referenced within the
            
            composing protocol.

      </informalexample>
      <para>
        An example of the nested variation, using the
        <emphasis role="italics">run</emphasis>
        , is:
      </para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting role="XML" ><![CDATA[run PlaceOrder(Client, Supplier) at Client;
....
protocol PlaceOrder(role Buyer, role Seller) {
    ....
}]]></programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>
        The external variation is similar to the nested variation above, except
        
        that the composed protocol definition (i.e. PlaceOrder in this case), would
        
        be stored in a separate definition.
