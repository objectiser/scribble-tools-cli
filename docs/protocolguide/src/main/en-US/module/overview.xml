	<para>
	Scribble is a simple text based language for describing interactions between multiple
	parties in the form of a <emphasis>Protocol</emphasis>.
	</para>
	  
	<para>
	The <emphasis>Protocol</emphasis> notation is intended to provide an abstract description
	of the communication behaviour, with addtional optional layers being used to describe
	assertions and other governance related information.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	In the world of programming languages, the measure of the simplicity of a language
	is based on its representation of a simple 'hello world' example. The Scribble
	Protocol representation of such an example would be: 
	</para>
	
	<informalexample>
  		<programlisting>
			<emphasis role="bold">protocol</emphasis> HelloWorld {
			    <emphasis role="bold">role</emphasis> You, World;
			    Hello <emphasis role="bold">from</emphasis> You <emphasis role="bold">to</emphasis> World;
			}
  		</programlisting>
  	</informalexample>

	<para>
	The notation will be explained in more detail in this guide, but basically the
	protocol is named 'HelloWorld', and describes the communication behaviour between
	two roles (or parties). A single interaction has been defined, sending a message
	of type 'Hello' from role 'You' to role 'World'.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	In the following chapter we will explore the main constructs of the protocol
	notation. Then we will explore a range of examples, before concluding with a
	brief overview of some more advanced constructs that are still under development.
